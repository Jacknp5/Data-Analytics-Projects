*** Clinical Data Analysis ***

520 patients of varying ages visiting a clinic presented with 14 clinical presentations (signs and symptoms) usually indicative of Diabetes Mellitus. 
Preliminary plasma glucose measurements showed that some of the patients were in fact diabetic, while some of them were not diabetic despite their clinical presentations.

The aim of the project was to explore the distribution of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) positive patients in the clinic based on age and gender.
The project also aimed to determine the most significant clinical presentations in the patients that were diabetic. 
It is nor advisable to make predictions based on this model due to the small sample size used. This is essentially a descriptive model.

TOOLS USED FOR THE DATA ANALYSIS -- The main tools used in the project are Python (utilising Jupyter Notebook), Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint.

NOTE -- Prior to running the Python code, ensure that the Jupyter Notebook file (i.e diabetes_mellitus_risk_prediction_model.ipynb)  and the raw data
(i.e diabetes_risk_prediction_raw_dataset.csv) are in the same directory.
